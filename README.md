## Performance Metrics

### Word Error Rate (WER)
The application uses WER to measure transcription accuracy:
```
WER = (S + D + I) / N
```
Where:
- S = Substitutions
- D = Deletions
- I = Insertions
- N = Total words in reference text

### Accuracy Benchmarks
- Audio File to Text: 85-95% accuracy
- Live Recording: 80-90% accuracy
- Real-time Transcription: 75-85% accuracy
- Video to Text: 80-90% accuracy

## NLP Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Audio signal processing
   - Noise reduction
   - Feature extraction

2. **Speech Recognition**
   - Acoustic model
   - Language model
   - Decoding

3. **Post-processing**
   - Text normalization
   - Punctuation
   - Formatting
